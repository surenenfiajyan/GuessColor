# GuessColor game
## Description
This game is also known as [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)). The goal of this game is to guess 4 different colors with as few attempts as possible using a provided hint after each guess. After submitting your guess you get a hint saying how many colors are correct and in correct positions and home many are correct but in wrong positions. This implemetation also has the "reverse game" which is the opposite, the computer guesses your chosen colors using the hints provided by you. On average it requires 5 - 6 attempts to guess in the case of 10 different possible colors that the game has.
